          We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your
          data from being accidentally lost, used, or accessed in an
          unauthorized way, altered, or disclosed. In addition, we limit access

          purposes we collected it for, including the purposes of satisfying any
          legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.
          <br /><br />
          To determine the appropriate retention period for data, we consider
          the amount, nature, and sensitivity of the data, the potential risk of
          harm from unauthorized use or disclosure of your data, the purposes
          for which we process your data, and whether we can achieve those
          purposes through other means, and the applicable legal requirements.
          <br /><br />
          By law we have to keep basic information about our customers,
          including contact details and details regarding any contracts which
          you may have entered into as a result of our Services for six years
          after the conclusion of the contract, taking into account the
          applicable prescriptive period at law. We may also retain certain data
          to ensure compliance with our legal obligations. In particular, we
          shall retain AML documentation for six years in compliance with the
          Prevention of Money Laundering Act (Chapter 377 of the Laws of Malta)
          and may retain certain transactional and financial information for a
          period not exceeding ten years, in compliance with tax and accounting
          reporting legal obligations.
          <br /><br />
          In some circumstances, we may anonymize your data (so that it can no
          longer be associated with you) for research or statistical purposes in
          which case we may use this information indefinitely without further
          notice to you.

          laws concerning your data. Under applicable data protection laws, you
          are entitled to exercise the following rights:
          <br /><br />
          You have the right to:
          <br /><br />
          Request access to your data (commonly known as a “data subject access

          about you and to check that we are lawfully processing it.
          <br /><br />
          Request correction of the data that we hold about you. This enables
          you to have any incomplete or inaccurate data we hold about you
          corrected, though we may need to verify the accuracy of the new data
          you provide to us.
          <br /><br />
          Request erasure of your data. This enables you to ask us to delete or
          remove data where there is no good reason for us to continue to
          process it. You also have the right to ask us to delete or remove your
          data where you have successfully exercised your right to object to
          processing (see below), where we may have processed your information
          unlawfully or where we are required to erase your data to comply with
          local law. Note, however, that we may not always be able to comply
          with your request of erasure for specific legal reasons which will be
          notified to you, if applicable, at the time of your request.
          <br /><br />
          Object to the processing of your data where we are relying on a
          legitimate interest (or those of a third party) and there is something
          about your particular situation which makes you want to object to
          processing on this ground as you feel it impacts your fundamental
          rights and freedoms. You also have the right to object to where we are
          processing your data for direct marketing purposes. In some cases, we
          may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to process
          your information which override your rights and freedoms.
          <br /><br />
          Request restriction of processing of your data. This enables you to
          ask us to suspend the processing of your data in the following
          scenarios: (a) if you want us to establish the data’s accuracy; (b)
          where our use of the data is unlawful but you do not want us to erase
          it; (c) where you need us to hold the data even if we no longer
          require it as you need it to establish, exercise or defend legal
          claims; or (d) you have objected to our use of your data but we need
          to verify whether we have overriding legitimate grounds to use it.
          <br /><br />
          Request the transfer of your data to you or a third party. We will
          provide to you, or a third party you have chosen, your data in a
          structured, commonly used, machine-readable format. Note that this
          right only applies to automated information which you initially
          provided consent for us to use or where we used the information to
          perform a contract with you.
          <br /><br />
          Withdraw consent at any time where we are relying on consent to
          process your data. However, this will not affect the lawfulness of any
          processing carried out before you withdraw your consent. If you
          withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide certain products
          or services to you. We will advise you if this is the case at the time
          you withdraw your consent.

        <h4 class="text-xl my-6 font-semibold">No fee is usually required</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">
          You will not have to pay a fee to access your data (or to exercise any
          of the other rights). However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your
          request is unfounded, repetitive, or excessive. Alternatively, we may
          refuse to comply with your request in these circumstances.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-xl my-6 font-semibold">What we may need from you</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">
          We may need to request specific information from you to help us
          confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your data (or to
          exercise any of your other rights). This is a security measure to
          ensure that data is not disclosed to any person who has no right to
          receive it. We may also contact you to ask you for further information
          concerning your request to speed up our response.
        </p>
        <h4 class="text-xl my-6 font-semibold">Time limit to respond</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">
          We try to respond to all legitimate requests within one month.
          Occasionally it may take us longer than a month if your request is
          particularly complex or you have made several requests. In this case,
          we will notify you and keep you updated
